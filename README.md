# weather-dashboard

## Description
This is a project I did for school to showcase using API's to get infromation from other websites. In this case I made A weather dashboard app that
allows you to search up the name of a city (Must only be the city name can not include state or country at this time). When you do this it will add that state to your history and will display the current weather conditions inculding UV index and a 5 day forcast. You can click on your history to display the current weather and 5 day forcast. The largest challange was figureing out the API's especialy the geolocation (did not know open weather had a geolocation api). I feel i am getting realy good at Jquary and BootStrap more than anything im getting good at reading documention.
